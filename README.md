Overview of Project

Dana, a data journalist, was allowed to write a story within her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon, about a topic she was interested in. Dana, from McMinnville, decided to write a story on UFOs because her community has reported UFO sightings. Dana sought help collecting data throughout and looked to develop a website that could capture dates, locations, and possible shapes or designs of the UFOs.   For some time, however, the process uses JavaScript in the front end and HTML in the back end. We were able to develop a website that would capture the most needed information. 

Results

The process started by developing a sequel of data. We start by collecting data.js and app.js (JSON). Once I collected the data, I created a CSS (cascading style sheets) to coordinate and describe how the HTML is performed to display the JavaScript. Below are three JPNs giving a visual outcome of the results. 

1.	The first image shows the front end of the full website. You noticed a filter search table with Date, City, State, country, and shape. There is information concerning the website's purpose and several click buttons to gather areas where sightings have occurred

2.	The second image shows the table of comments and duration where the sightings occurred and the date and city.

3.	The third image shows the filter search table; this table is where you enter the date, city, and state of your desired locations throughout the US.

4.	The fourth image is the UFO Sightings click button. This button, once clicked, would reset the filter search button and return to the overall data.

Summary

Overall, the website gathered most of the information that Dana was seeking to interact with other journalists or enthusiast seekers attracted to UFO sightings. I did notice one Drawback and two recommendations to further development and inform others.  

**Drawback:**
1.	I noticed that the time of the discovery, which to me can be very important, was not displayed on the website. Having the time would show a pattern of when, why, and where sightings occur the most. 

**Recommendations;**

1.	If each recorded sightings have some photo button or click that could confirm each sighting. assure 

2.	The website appeared plain and needed more images, Q&A concerning UFOs, and videos of those who experienced the sighting of UFOs. This type of information can address those who doubt the website and gives the website a more friendly look and information gathering. 

**Conclusion:** 
A.	The website is in the beginning stage of development and could start what is needed for UFO sightings
